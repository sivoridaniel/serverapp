# REST client for C++ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrtazz/restclient-cpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrtazz/restclient-cpp)

## About
This is a simple REST client for C++. It wraps libcurl for HTTP requests.

## Usage
I tried to keep usage close to the [ruby rest-client][]. So the basic usage is:

    RestClient::method(url, content-type, params);

Examples:

    #include "restclient.h"

    RestClient::response r = RestClient::get("http://url.com")
    RestClient::response r = RestClient::post("http://url.com/post", "text/json", "{\"foo\": \"bla\"}")
    RestClient::response r = RestClient::put("http://url.com/put", "text/json", "{\"foo\": \"bla\"}")
    RestClient::response r = RestClient::del("http://url.com/delete")

The response is of type RestClient::response and has three attributes:

    RestClient::response.code // HTTP response code
    RestClient::response.body // HTTP response body
    RestClient::response.headers // HTTP response headers


## Dependencies
- [libcurl][]
- [gtest][] for development

- Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with version
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
